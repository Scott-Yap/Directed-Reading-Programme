    "|-------|--------------|----------|\n",
    "| **European Option** | Exercised *only at expiry*. You decide whether to exercise at maturity based on the final price $S_T$. | You buy a **European call** on the S&P 500 with strike 4500 expiring in 1 month. <br>• If at expiry $S_T = 4700$, you gain $4700 − 4500 = 200$. <br>• If $S_T = 4300$, it expires worthless. |\n",
    "| **American Option** | Can be exercised *anytime before expiry*. Useful when early exercise might be optimal (e.g. due to dividends). | You buy an **American call** on Apple at strike £150. <br>• If Apple announces a dividend soon and trades at £180, you might **exercise early** to receive the dividend. <br>• Otherwise, you typically wait until expiry. |\n",
    "| **Asian Option** | Payoff depends on the *average* price of the underlying over time, not just the final price. | You buy an **Asian call** on oil with strike $80, based on the **average daily oil price** over the next month. <br>• If the average is $85$, payoff = $85 − 80 = $5. <br>• Helps smooth out short-term price spikes. |\n",
    "| **Barrier Option** | Activated or deactivated if the underlying hits a certain barrier level. | You buy a **knock-out call** on gold with strike $2000$ and barrier $2100$. <br>• If gold ever hits $2100$, your option **expires immediately** (knocked out). <br>• If it never touches $2100$ and finishes above $2000$, you get the payoff. |\n",
    "| **Digital / Binary Option** | Fixed payout if condition met; otherwise zero. Often used for *probability* or *event* trading. | You buy a **binary option** paying £100 if EUR/USD > 1.10 in 2 weeks, else £0. <br>• If it ends at 1.11 → you get £100. <br>• If 1.09 → nothing. <br>Price of the option ≈ implied probability × £100. |\n",
